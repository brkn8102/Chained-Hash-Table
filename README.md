# Dynamic and Customizable Hash Table

## Project Summary

This program is basically a hash table with added functionality. The essential feature is that this hash table has a dynamic capability which allows for the user to set a maximum number of allowed collisions for any given chain in the table. If this threshold is exceeded as data is inputted into the table, then the table is resized as necessary so that the the number of collisions in any chain is below or at the allowed value. This dynamic capability (which can be turned on or off), as well as the maximum number of allowed collisions, can be changed at any time. Also, the program allows for the user to set the table size. The basic data structure used to store information in this hash table is a struct called an "Element," which contains two properties: a key (string) and a value (int).

## How to Run

This	section contains	instructions,	with	examples,	of	how	to	run	your	program.	You	
should	also	include	a	link	here	to	the	project	documentation	that	you	will	provide	in	
a	separate	file.

## Dependencies

This	section	contains	a	description	of	any	dependencies	that	your	program	requires.	
For	example,	if	your	program	relies	on	another	third-party	library	that	needs	to	be	
installed,	you	should	provide	a	description	of	where	to	find	that	library	and	
instructions	for	how	to	install	it.

## System Requirements

This program has been used on both Mac (with Xcode) and Linux (with Code::Blocks) operating systems.
